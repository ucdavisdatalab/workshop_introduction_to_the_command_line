# Introduction to the Unix Command Line

Instruction notes by Michele Tobias

## 1 Overview

Today we're learning Unix Command Line!

Why do we want to know this?

 * It allows us to talk directly to our computers
 

What kinds of tasks can we use it for?

 * Manage files - especially bulk tasks like moving files
 * Run programs
 * Running programs on remote servers like our compute clusters
 * Version control tools like Git
 * Setting up virtual environments with tools like Docker
 * Installing software and packages for programming languages


## 2 Preliminaries

### Objectives

By the end of the workshop, learners should be able to:

 * Explain the directory structure of their computers
 * Navigate across and within files and directories
 * Create, copy, move, and delete files
 * Use command line tools to edit files
 * Identify where to go for help and to learn more
 
 
 ### Prerequisites
 
 I'm going to assume you're installed some form of Command Line Interface on your computer.
 

### 3 Installation

We're skipping this because you've already done it.
